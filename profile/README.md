# OmniSat

## DeFi Primatives Metaprotocol based on Ordinal Theory


### What is OmniSat?

OmniSat is a community-driven organization built to design solutions for Bitcoin Native DeFi Primitives. DeFi relies on decentralized connected liquidity. OmniSat's Bitcoin-native approach is designed for composable solutions. It is intended that OmniSat primitives create network effects that enable various decentralized finance markets built on Bitcoin.

Core Primitives and products described throughout the documentation include: Bitcoin-pegged BRC-20 compatible tokens, a decentralized exchange powered by an AMM framework, yield instruments, and bond instruments. OmniSat's products and primitives are designed around the concept of protocol-owned liquidity. Protocol-owned liquidity enables reward guarantees. In times of market distress when liquidity is most needed, it's protected by bond terms, effectively safeguarding markets from death spirals initiated when yield-chasing mercenary capital is withdrawn, thus mitigating risks.

The documentation provides comprehensive details about the technical and operational aspects of OmniSat primitives and the product ecosystem.
